## About
Learning cards for online training  using the question-answer system
with the ability to create your own training modules (card decks),
as well as their expansion (creating new cards), editing and privacy
settings. The project also implemented a learning process with a rating
system for assessing the knowledge of the material covered and a counter
for passing training cards. The project has the ability to search for
educational cards, as well as two-level filtering.
